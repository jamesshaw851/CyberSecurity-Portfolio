# Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Overview  
This repository is a collection of hands-on cybersecurity labs, reports, and projects designed to demonstrate both **blue team (defensive)** and **red team (offensive)** skills.  
It will evolve over time as I progress through my studies, beginning with foundational labs and building towards more advanced simulations of real-world attack and defense scenarios.

The portfolio aligns with the skills covered in **CompTIA Security+** and goes beyond by including practical demonstrations in networking, system hardening, threat detection, and penetration testing.

## Goals  

### Learning Goals  
- Develop a strong foundation in networking, operating systems, and security concepts.  
- Build hands-on experience with security tools (Wireshark, Nmap, Kali Linux, Wazuh, etc.).  
- Understand both attacker tactics (red team) and defender strategies (blue team).  
- Practice documenting findings in a clear, professional format.  

### Portfolio Goals  
- Showcase technical skills for future employers and recruiters.  
- Provide structured, evidence-based reports for each lab.  
- Demonstrate growth from beginner-friendly labs to advanced incident response projects.  
- Keep a consistent, version-controlled record of all work.

## Long-Term Vision  
By the end of this portfolio, I aim to have:  
- A complete set of lab reports showing practical security skills.  
- End-to-end attack & defense projects simulating real-world incidents.  
- A public demonstration of my journey from Security+ student to aspiring cybersecurity professional.
